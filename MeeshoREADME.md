We are in Unit 3 and given the task of the successful cloning of a website named Meesho.

Team Members namely as — Prakash Gupta, Sunil Sahu, Priya Desmukh, Mohd Monish, Ramanjeet Singh, Vikash Mandal.
Expectations:
We are expecting to create a pixel-perfect cloned site of Meesho’s website within 5days, with all its pages, giving proper HTML, and CSS properties, using DOM, Fetch Import-export, and media query concepts concerning the official Meesho website.
#Roles and Responsibilities:

We started by going through the website, studying its design, layouts, content, etc.
We started to go with the first page 1st. We divided the website into different pages. Like-landing page, SignUp page, Product Page, Add to the cart page, Product related contents page, Address page, check-out page, etc.
Prakash worked on the Landing page like- Navigation bar popup, body, and slides of the home page.
Sunil worked on the Login and Signup functionality.
Priya worked on the products page related to their details, size, and sellers.
Monish worked on purchasing products that will go to the cart and be saved there.
After the add-cart page, Ramanjeet created an address page for the delivery of the product.
And also Monish worked on the total price of whole products and checkout page and then the redirect goes to the home page.
In the end, we had to combine all the works and upload them on GitHub.
*CHALLENGES WE FACED AND HOW WE SOLVED THEM

As it was the 2nd time for us to collaborate remotely on a proton .We faced quite a few challenges while developing the clone. The challenges we can remember are as follows:-

Git was just new to us and thus it became a challenge the merge the code on GitHub.
Another challenge was solving the problem of the JavaScript part of local storage. It happened sometimes that there were few redundant classes and the output used to get disoriented. Solving it required a thorough checkup of class names and effective communication among us so that we could prevent it from happening.
We were facing difficulty while going to make an add-cart and filtering of products.
As we are not using UI libraries yet, we faced a lot of challenges while getting a similar layout with different screen sizes. Although we were able to manage most of it, this issue is something that we got to know could only be resolved with the UI libraries, so we decide to move on and fix other things.
